# Contributing

All contributions are welcome. Contributions can be in the form of pull requests, bug reports, or suggestions.

## Pull Requests

Start with creating an issue. It can be discussed and reviewed. Test it out, then submit a pull request.

### Merge Process

* Once the pull request has been submitted, it will be merged into the main repository and then those changes will be migrated into the primary development branch at [dev.kpfanworld.com](https://dev.kpfanworld.com) for review and live testing.

* After testing and further review the changes will be merged into the live branch.

## Bug Reports / Suggestions

Start an issue and it will be reviewed.

### Creating Issues

Please include the following when reporting a bug:

* Browser (brand, version)
* OS (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, etc) and version (Windows 10, Windows 7, etc)
* Mobile/Desktop and display resolution
* Page where the bug occurred
* What you were doing when the bug occurred
* Please be specific about what you were seeing. This will make it easier to debug and will require fewer follow-up questions.
  * Avoid descriptions like "hover effects aren't working" or "the button isn't working"
  * A more descriptive (and helpful) statement might be "I clicked submit and nothing happened and it said CAPTCHA failed, but the checkbox was green"
